As part of the [ACM conference on Fairness, Accountability, and Transparency (FAT\*)](https://fatconference.org/2020/index.html), taking place from January 27th to January 30th in Barcelona, Spain, we cordially invite participation in a plenary discussion on when we should not design, build, and deploy models and systems. This is part of the [Critiquing and Rethinking Accountability, Fairness and Transparency (CRAFT)](https://fatconference.org/2020/callforcraft.html) track at FAT*.

**Session date and time:**
The 90-min session will take place on Wed, Jan 29, 5-6:30 pm, in the conference's plenary room. (See [https://fatconference.org/2020/programschedule.html](https://fatconference.org/2020/programschedule.html).)

### Background
While much FAT* work to date has focused on various model and system interventions, the goal of this session will be to foster discussion of when we should not design, build, and deploy models and systems in the first place. Given the recent push for moratoria on facial recognition, protests around the sale of digital technologies, and the ongoing harms to marginalized groups from automated systems such as risk prediction, a broader discussion around how, when, and why to say _no_ as academics, practitioners, activists, and society, seems both relevant and urgent.

This interactive gathering will feature diverse invited and contributed perspectives presented in a fishbowl conversation format, accompanied by questions and comments from the audience. While the central focus of this discussion will be on individual instances of pat refusal efforts, the high-level goal of the session is to create a foundation for answering long-term questions of: (i) relevant historical and disciplinary contexts, (ii) frameworks and guidelines for practitioners to use when reasoning about ‘not designing, building, or deploying’, and (iii) the broader politics and aftermaths of refusal.

### Session plan
I. (10 mins)  
* Welcome  
* Opening remarks

II.  When Not to Design, Build, or Deploy (frameworks, contexts) (40 mins)
* Opening statements from the featured speakers
* Conversation with featured speakers
* "Fishbowl" conversation open to the audience

III. How Not to Design, Build, or Deploy (practice, politics) (40 mins)
* Opening statements from the featured speakers
* Conversation with featured speakers
* "Fishbowl" conversation open to the audience

<details><summary>Laurence Diver (Vrije Universiteit Brussel)</summary>
Laurence is a postdoctoral researcher in COHUBICOL, a multidisciplinary ERC Advanced Grant-funded project investigating how the foundational principles that underpin modern law can be retained, and if necessary adapted, as legal practice and the legal system are increasingly mediated by code- and data-driven systems. He holds first-class LLB and LLM degrees from the University of Edinburgh, where recently he defended a multidisciplinary Ph.D. synthesising legal-theoretical notions of legitimacy with the theory of design (title: “Digisprudence: the affordance of legitimacy in code-as-law”). You can read more about his research at laurenced.org, or follow him on twitter @laurence_diver.

<details><summary>Varoon Mathur (AI Now Institute) </summary>
As a Technology Fellow, I conduct interdisciplinary research on the social implications of machine learning and related technologies on public domains. My specific interests include research on the limitation of Electronic Health Records (EHRs) for the purposes of building predictive algorithms for health care, as well as the specific limitations of fairness metrics and bias mitigation techniques for emotion/facial recognition, and how social systems analysis can be a part of auditing sociotechnical systems.

I joined AI Now after serving as a Microsoft Data Science for Social Good Fellow, and earning his software engineering degree from UBC with a focus in machine learning. I am also a global health activist, and a Co-ordinating Committee Fellow with Universities Allied for Essential Medicines, a student-driven NGO focused on access to medicines issues for vulnerable and marginalized population. I have advised on global health policy and research at the World Health Organization, and am a former TEDx Speaker on AI Ethics in Health Care.
